The `OSD758` R data package provides a compact, real-world example dataset for
illustrating RNA-seq analysis workflows using the DESeq2 package in R. It
includes sample metadata and both raw and normalized gene expression counts
derived from optic nerve and retinal tissues of mice subjected to varying levels
of artificial gravity during spaceflight. The dataset, originally published in
NASA's Open Science Data Repository (OSD-758), offers a biologically meaningful
and technically appropriate starting point for teaching, demonstration, or
method development in differential gene expression analysis.

## Installation

You can install the development version of OSD758 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("patterninstitute/OSD758")
```
