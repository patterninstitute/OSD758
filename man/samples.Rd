\usage{
samples()
}
\value{
A tibble with 35 rows and 9 columns:

\describe{
\item{\code{sample_id}}{Unique identifier for each RNA-seq sample. Encodes group and replicate.}
\item{\code{organism}}{Biological species. All samples are from \emph{Mus musculus} (mouse).}
\item{\code{sex}}{Sex of the animal. All samples in this dataset are from male mice.}
\item{\code{matrix}}{Biological matrix from which RNA was extracted. In this dataset, all samples are from the right retina.}
\item{\code{spacecraft}}{The platform or habitat in which the mouse was housed:
\itemize{
\item \code{"ISS"} — aboard the International Space Station.
\item \code{"Earth"} — ground-based control under comparable conditions.
}
Note that the term "spacecraft" is used here to denote the physical environment supporting life during the experiment, including ground controls.}
\item{\code{acceleration_source}}{Describes the physical mechanism by which the mouse experienced gravitational acceleration:
\itemize{
\item \code{"Terrestrial Gravity"} — natural 1G gravity at Earth's surface due to planetary mass.
\item \code{"Centrifugal Acceleration"} — artificial gravity generated by rotating the mouse habitat in a centrifuge aboard the ISS.
\item \code{"Orbital Free Fall"} — near-weightlessness resulting from continuous free fall in orbit (commonly referred to as \emph{microgravity}).
}
This variable separates the \emph{mechanism} of experienced acceleration from the \emph{platform} (\code{spacecraft}).}
\item{\code{gravity}}{Numeric representation of the effective gravitational acceleration (in multiples of Earth gravity, G) experienced by the sample. Values include:
\itemize{
\item \code{1} — either terrestrial 1G or 1G simulated via centrifuge on ISS.
\item \code{0.66} or \code{0.33} — partial gravity simulated by adjusting centrifuge speed.
\item \code{0.000001} — represents orbital free fall (a proxy for microgravity). Although gravitational pull is still ~90\% of Earth’s at ISS altitude, this reflects the net effective acceleration in the free-fall frame.}
This variable supports quantitative modeling of gravity-dependent effects.}

\item{\code{gravity_class}}{Effective gravity categories as a factor variable.}

\item{\code{weight_at_launch}}{Body weight of the animal at the time of launch (or analogous time point for ground controls), in grams.}
\item{\code{weight_at_euthanasia}}{Body weight of the animal at euthanasia, in grams. Used to assess weight changes across experimental conditions.}
}

\description{
\code{\link[=samples]{samples()}} returns a metadata table for the 35 mouse retina samples
collected in a spaceflight experiment conducted aboard the International
Space Station (ISS) and in matched ground-based controls on Earth.
It includes key information about the biological specimen, experimental
condition, and physical acceleration environment in which the mice were
housed during the mission.
