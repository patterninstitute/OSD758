Description: Provides sample metadata, raw counts, and normalized transcriptomic
    data from a NASA-funded experiment examining the effects of artificial
    gravity on ocular tissues during spaceflight. The dataset originates from
    the Open Science Data Repository study OSD-758, which includes RNA-seq
    profiles of mouse retina following exposure to varying
    gravity levels aboard the International Space Station. This package enables
    streamlined access and analysis of the data for reproducible research and
    teaching in space biology, transcriptomics, and gravitational physiology.
